# Configuration Management with Puppet

Puppet is a powerful open-source configuration management tool that automates the management of system configurations. It ensures consistency, stability, and security across multiple machines.

Key Features:
- Declarative language for defining desired configurations.
- Idempotent execution for stable and predictable results.
- Resource abstraction for reusable and modular configurations.
- Dependency management to handle configuration order and conflicts.
- Reporting and auditing capabilities for tracking changes and detecting drift.

Getting Started:
1. Install Puppet server and agents.
2. Write Puppet manifests using Puppet DSL.
3. Define desired configurations and organize them into classes.
4. Leverage Puppet modules for common configurations.
5. Configure agents to connect to the server.
6. Run the Puppet agent to apply configurations.

With Puppet, you can automate and manage system configurations efficiently, reducing errors and ensuring consistent environments.
