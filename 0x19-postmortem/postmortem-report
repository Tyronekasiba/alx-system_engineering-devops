**Postmortem: Service Outage on Alx-online shop- 503 Service Unavailable Incident**

**Issue Summary:**

- Duration: August 10, 2023, 08:30 AM - August 10, 2023, 10:45 AM (EAT)
- Impact: The Alx-online shop  Platform experienced a service outage with a 503 Service Unavailable error, impacting approximately 35% of users during the incident window.

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause of the outage was identified as a sudden and unexpected surge in user traffic, overwhelming backend resources, and leading to a service degradation resulting in 503 errors.

**Timeline:**

- 08:30 AM: Issue detected as monitoring alerts highlighted increased response times and escalating error rates.
- 08:35 AM: On-call engineer received an automated alert and initiated an investigation.
- 08:40 AM: Initial assumption: Network issues or load balancer misconfigurations affecting backend communication.
- 08:50 AM: Load balancer configurations reviewed and confirmed to be correctly set.
- 09:00 AM: Misleading investigation: Focus shifted to backend service response times and database performance.
- 09:30 AM: Incident escalated to backend and database teams for further analysis.
- 10:00 AM: Detailed analysis revealed excessive user traffic exceeding backend capacity and causing 503 errors.
- 10:15 AM: Increased backend resources and optimized resource utilization to handle higher load.
- 10:45 AM: Incident resolved, service availability restored, and 503 errors mitigated.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- Root Cause: Sudden surge in user traffic exceeding backend capacity, causing service degradation and 503 errors.
- Resolution: Increased backend resources, optimized resource utilization, and scaled infrastructure to accommodate higher load.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- To enhance capacity and minimize similar occurrences:
    1. Implement automatic scaling of backend resources based on traffic spikes.
    2. Establish traffic throttling mechanisms to prevent overwhelming backend resources.
    3. Enhance monitoring with alerts for response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
    4. Define clear communication channels and incident escalation paths.
    5. Conduct regular load testing to assess platform capacity and resilience.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

1. Configure auto-scaling rules for backend resources to manage sudden traffic influxes.
2. Develop and deploy traffic throttling mechanisms to prevent service degradation under heavy load.
3. Enhance monitoring with alerts for key performance metrics and resource utilization thresholds.
4. Review and update incident escalation procedures for the swift engagement of relevant teams.
5. Conduct periodic load tests to evaluate and improve the platform's ability to handle peak traffic.
